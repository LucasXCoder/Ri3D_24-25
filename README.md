# goBILDA Robot in 3 Days 2024-2025 Resources Repository 
The goBILDA Robot in 3 Days is a live stream we do once a year following the FIRST Tech Challenge Kickoff
In this Repo, you'll find the .step (3d CAD) file for the robot we built, the code that runs the robot, and a bill-of-materials.

## How to Use Example Code
download the .java file and either copy it into your teamcode folder in Android Studio, or upload it to your Control Hub for Onbot Java. 

# Bill of Materials (Using Kits)
Using kits:
We built this robot using three kits, the FTC Starter Kit, a Strafer Chassis, and a 2 Stage Viper Slide Kit. This BoM assumes that you also get/have those three kits.
